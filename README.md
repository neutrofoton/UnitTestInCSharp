# NeutroLab.XUnit
**NeutroLab.XUnit** is a project that contains UnitTest classes that are extended from xUnit classes. 
We can use the UnitTest classes by inheriting from them in handling test execution order, sharing data between test fixture, and configuration reader.

**NeutroLab.BusinessLogic** and **NeutroLab.BusinessLogic.Test** are just a simple example of library and test project that use NeutroLab.XUnit in applying test scenario.
